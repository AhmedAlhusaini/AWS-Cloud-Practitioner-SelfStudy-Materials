In the context of storage, especially in AWS, throughput refers to the amount of data that can be transferred to or from a storage system within a given time period. It's typically measured in megabytes per second (MB/s) or gigabytes per second (GB/s).

Types of Throughput in AWS Storage
Elastic Throughput: Automatically scales up or down based on the workload activity. Ideal for unpredictable workloads1.

Provisioned Throughput: You specify a fixed level of throughput that the storage system can handle, regardless of the workload. Suitable for predictable workloads1.

Bursting Throughput: Allows temporary increases in throughput based on the amount of storage provisioned. Useful for workloads with occasional spikes in demand1.

Example Scenarios
Elastic Throughput: A web application with varying traffic patterns. During peak hours, the throughput increases to handle the load, and during off-peak hours, it decreases to save costs1.

Provisioned Throughput: A database that requires consistent read/write operations. The throughput is set to a fixed level to ensure performance stability1.

Bursting Throughput: A media streaming service that experiences high traffic during new releases or events. The throughput can burst to accommodate the sudden increase in demand1.

Low to Moderate, Up to 10 Gbps, etc.
Low to Moderate: Suitable for applications with minimal network requirements.

Up to 10 Gbps: Indicates the instance can handle network speeds up to 10 Gigabits per second, suitable for high-performance networking tasks.
