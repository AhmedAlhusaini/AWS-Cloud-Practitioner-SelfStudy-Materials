In the context of storage, especially in AWS, **I/O** stands for **Input/Output** operations. This term is commonly used to describe the read and write operations that are performed on a storage device.

### Understanding I/O in AWS Storage
1. **I/O Operations per Second (IOPS)**: This is a measure of the number of read and write operations that a storage device can handle per second. Higher IOPS indicate better performance for applications that require frequent access to data.
2. **Throughput**: This is the amount of data that can be read from or written to a storage device in a given period of time, typically measured in megabytes per second (MB/s) or gigabytes per second (GB/s).

### Scenarios for I/O
- **High IOPS Requirement**:
  - Applications that require quick access to data, such as databases and online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
  - Use cases: EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2) volumes.
  
- **High Throughput Requirement**:
  - Applications that require large amounts of data to be transferred, such as big data analytics, streaming, and data warehousing.
  - Use cases: EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) or EBS Cold HDD (sc1) volumes for lower-cost, high-throughput storage.

### Example Terminology
- **Low to Moderate IOPS**: Suitable for less demanding workloads, such as development and testing environments.
- **Up to 10,000 IOPS**: Indicates that the storage device can handle up to 10,000 read/write operations per second, suitable for high-performance applications.
- **Up to 500 MB/s Throughput**: Indicates that the storage device can transfer up to 500 megabytes of data per second, suitable for data-intensive applications.

Understanding the difference between I/O and throughput can help you choose the right AWS storage solution for your specific needs.
